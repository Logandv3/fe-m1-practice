1. The purpose of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is to describe the structure and presentation
of information via the internet.  You use keywords and tags to instruct the browser app to format and display
the content of web pages.

2. Tags are labels you use to mark up the beginning and ending of an element. An element is the tags and stuff
in between. <p class="foo">This is a paragraph.</p>

3. Attributes define additional characteristics or properties of an element like the width and height of an image.
They are specified in the opening tag.  Attributes are a modifier of default HTML element type or provide some
function to some element types.

4. <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> and <body> tag.
Metadata is about the HTML document and is not displayed.  Metadata typically defines the document title, character
set, styles, scripts and other meta information.

<title> element defines the document's title that is shown in a browser title bar or page tab.  It only contains
text.

<body> element contains all the contents of an HTML document such as headings, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists etc.
